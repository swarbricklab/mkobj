# mkseurat Configuration Template
# Edit this file according to your dataset structure

# Dependencies
deps:
  # Path to filtered feature barcode matrices from Cell Ranger
  # Each capture should be a subdirectory containing barcodes.tsv.gz, features.tsv.gz, matrix.mtx.gz
  cellranger: "data/sc/cellranger/count/filtered"
  
  # CSV file listing captures to process (requires 'capture' column)
  captures: "config/chromium-preprocessing/captures.csv"
  
  # [Optional] CSV file for subsetting cells by sample
  # Must have 'sample_id' and 'capture_id' columns. For each capture, only cells
  # assigned to sample_ids listed for that capture will be kept.
  # Doublets and unassigned cells are always retained.
  # samples: "samples.csv"
  
  # [Optional] Path to sample assignment files from SNP demux
  # Each capture should have {capture}/cell_assignment.tsv
